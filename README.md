Traditional approaches (.ipynb) was contributed by Zhang Tianyu, Zhou Runbing and Sun Chang.
ResNet was contributed by Ma Yuhan and Zhang Tianyu.
ViT was contributed by Cheng Zhengxing and Zhang Tianyu.

ResNet and ViT code framework was largely adopted from  github https://github.com/WZMIAOMIAO/deep-learning-for-image-processing/tree/master/pytorchclassification. We did minor modifications to cater to our project requirements.
